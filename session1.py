# write a program to calculate the number of minis in the maxis,
# total maxis is 2.5*minis
# 1 mini is 5000
# calculate how much is 4.5 maxis 

minis is 500
maxis is 2.5*minis
 so 4.5 maxis is equal to 2.5*4.5*minis
Display maxis

minis = 500
maxis = 2.5*minis
print ("the value for maxis is: ",4.5*maxis)
